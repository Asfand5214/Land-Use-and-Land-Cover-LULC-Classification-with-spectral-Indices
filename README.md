# **Land-Use-and-Land-Cover-LULC-Classification-with-spectral-Indices**

# Project Overview
This Project leverages **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **Sentinel-2** satellite imagery to classify land cover types in **Lahore, Pakistan** from within **Google Colab** environment. The workflow retrieves cloud-free imagery, computes spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, NDBI), trains a **Random Forest** classifier to **separate water, vegetation and built up areas**, evaluates accuracy using a confusion matrix, generates NDVI histogram
